# API-Gateway-Realtime-Project
we will create a simple  e-commerce  application using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. We will create the following microservices:
1)Product Service: Manages product information.
2)Order Service: Manages customer orders.
3)Inventory Service: Manages product inventory.
4)Eureka Server: Service discovery.
5)API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point to the system.

Explanation:
1)Postman Client: Used for testing the APIs. This client sends requests to the API Gateway.

2)API Gateway: The single entry point to the system, handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate microservice.

3)Eureka Server: This is the service discovery component where all microservices register themselves. It enables the discovery of services for communication.

4)Product Service: Manages product information such as details, pricing, and availability.

5)Order Service: Manages customer orders, processing new orders, updating order status, etc.

6)Inventory Service: Manages product inventory, keeping track of stock levels and updating inventory records.

The Postman client sends requests to the API Gateway, which uses the Eureka Server to locate the appropriate microservice. Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server and communicates with other microservices as needed.
Conclusion
You have successfully set up a basic e-commerce application using Spring Boot microservices architecture. This setup includes a Product Service, Order Service, Inventory Service, Eureka Server for service discovery, and an API Gateway. This example can be expanded with more features such as user management, payment processing, and more complex business logic.
